Running ERC...
You have run CvPcb for the first time using the new footprint library table method for finding footprints.
CvPcb has either copied the default table or created an empty table in your home folder.
You must first configure the library table to include all footprint libraries not included with KiCad.
See the “Footprint Library Table” section of the CvPcb documentation for more information. Checking sheet names...
